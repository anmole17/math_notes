# Road to understanding mathematics

This is my journey to learn and understand mathematics from the basics to the advanced level.
Learning mathematics for fun and implication in bioinformatics and machine learning.
Currently studying mathematics for my masters of science in bioinformatics and biotechnology.

## Aims to complete

1. Learn 10th class mathematics. -- Working  
This includes basic algebra, trigonometry, geometry, statistics and probability.

2. Learn 11th-12th class mathematics.  
This includes better and deep learning of pre-calculus and calculus. Along with other important topics.

3. Undergraduate mathematics.  
After undergraduate mathematics, the learning of advanced topics will be the emphasis.

## Method of learning

- Solving problems and reading examples will be most important.

- Cannot move to the next step unless the understanding of the basics seems weak. Unlike a classroom method of studying for a year and moving to next year's syllabus.  
Self-paced learning of this type should emphasize understanding each example and topic properly and then moving on. 

- After completion of each level of mathematics/bid topic, give me a final self-exam, without time limit, but also including all methods and examples in detail in each answer.
Self-checking along with taking help to check my exam if possible.

Notes are written using LaTex, there will be questions from Project Euler (To help in learning programming), CodeChef, CodeForces, Art of Problem Solving and other sources included.

## Topics studied till now

1. Linear algebra: Basics, including matricies, determinants, matrix algebra,etc
2. Calculus:
    - Differentiation: Derivative of a function, differentiation, second and higher order derivatives, L'Hospital's rule for finding limits, implicit differentiation, partial derivatives, etc
    - Integration: Indefinite integrals, integration methods. Summation of series, Riemann sums and definite
    integral, evaluation of definite integrals, Area under the curve, average values of continuous
    functions, etc

3. Sequence and series:Fundamental concepts, convergence tests, alternating series, series of a function and Taylor
expansion.

4. Statistics: fundamental concepts, Hypothesis testing and error analysis, including all important statistical tests for parametric and non parametric tests.
