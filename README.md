# Road to understanding mathematics

This is my journey to learn and understand mathematics from the basics to the advanced level. 
Learning mathematics for fun and implication in bioinformatics and machine learning.

##Aims to complete:

1. Learn 10th class mathematics. -- Working
	This includes basic algebra, trigonometry, geometry, statistics and probability.
2. Learn 11th-12th class mathematics.  
	This includes better and deep learning of pre-calculus and calculus. Along with other important topics.
3. Undergraduate mathematics.

After undergraduate mathematics, the learning of advanced topics will be the emphasis.

##Method of learning:

- Solving problems and reading examples will be most important.
- Cannot move to the next step unless the understanding of the basics seems weak. Unlike a classroom method of studying for a year and moving to next year's syllabus.
	Self-paced learning of this type should emphasise understanding each example and topic properly and then moving on. 
- After completion of each level of mathematics/bid topic, give me a final self-exam, without time limit, but also including all methods and examples in detail in each answer.
	Self-checking along with taking help to check my exam if possible. 

Notes are written using LaTex, there will be questions from Project Euler(To help in learning programming) or Art of Solving Problems included.
